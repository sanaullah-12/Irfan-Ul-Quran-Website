IMPORTANT: Image Setup Instructions
=====================================

To complete the homepage setup, please follow these steps:

1. Save the Quran image you provided (the one with the open Quran and prayer beads) to this folder:
   Path: d:\Quran Website\public\

2. Name the file exactly as: quran-hero.jpg

3. The image should be high quality (the one you uploaded showing the open Quran with wooden prayer beads on a stand)

The code has been updated to use this image at /quran-hero.jpg

After completing this step:
- The homepage will display your beautiful real Quran photo instead of the SVG illustration
- The image will have proper styling with rounded corners, shadow effects, and overlay gradients
- It will integrate seamlessly with the rest of the design

If you need to use a different filename or format:
- Update the src attribute in pages/index.tsx (line ~177)
- Change: src="/quran-hero.jpg" to your preferred filename

Current location to edit: d:\Quran Website\pages\index.tsx (around line 177)
